## 1. Project Scope and Objectives

### Scope

The aim of the "Keylogger" project is to develop a software application that records keystrokes on a computer. This tool captures and logs all keyboard inputs, which can be used for monitoring and analyzing user activity. The main goal is to demonstrate the potential risks and ethical concerns associated with keylogging technology, emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity measures to prevent unauthorized monitoring. The project focuses on educating users about the dangers of keyloggers, how they operate, and the significance of maintaining secure computing environments to protect sensitive information.

### Objectives

1. **Functional Keylogger:** Create a fully functional keylogger that can capture and log keystrokes effectively.
2. **File Handling:** Implement robust file handling to log captured data into a text file.
3. **User Input Handling:** Handle different types of keystrokes, including alphanumeric and special keys.
4. **Education and Awareness:** Educate users on the risks and ethical considerations of keyloggers.
5. **Termination Mechanism:** Provide a mechanism to stop the keylogger cleanly using a specific key press.

## 2. Methodologies and Techniques

### Methodologies

- **Python Scripting:** The project uses Python for its simplicity and extensive library support.
- **Event-Driven Programming:** Utilizes an event-driven approach to detect and log keystrokes as they occur.
- **File I/O Operations:** Implement file operations to write keystrokes to a log file.
- **Listener Pattern:** Uses the listener pattern from `pynput` to monitor keyboard events.

### Techniques

- **Keyboard Listener:** Utilizes `pynput.keyboard.Listener` to track key events.
- **Error Handling:** Implements try-except blocks to handle errors gracefully, particularly for special keys.
- **Condition Checks:** Checks for specific keys like 'space' and 'enter' to log them appropriately.

## 3. Requirements

### Hardware Requirements

- A computer with a keyboard.
- Basic storage for log file storage.

### Software Requirements

- **Operating System:** Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- **Python:** Python 3.x installed.
- **Libraries:** `pynput` library for capturing keyboard input.

### Dependencies

- **pynput:** The project depends on the `pynput` library, which needs to be installed via pip (`pip install pynput`).

## 4. Design and Implementation

### Design Overview

The keylogger is designed to listen for keyboard events and log them to a text file. The design is straightforward with a focus on simplicity and functionality. Key components include:
- **Listener Initialization:** A keyboard listener is initialized to monitor key presses and releases.
- **Event Handlers:** Functions are defined to handle key press and release events.
- **File Writing:** The captured keystrokes are written to a log file.
- **Termination Condition:** A specific key (such as 'esc') is used to stop the keylogger.

### Implementation Details

#### Key Press Handling

When a key is pressed, the keylogger attempts to write the character associated with that key to a log file. Regular alphanumeric keys are logged directly, while special keys (like space or enter) are handled with specific conditions to represent them appropriately in the log file.

#### Key Release Handling

The keylogger listens for key releases to determine if the 'esc' key has been pressed, which serves as the signal to stop logging and terminate the program. This ensures that the keylogger does not run indefinitely and provides a controlled method for stopping the application.

#### Listener Initialization

The keyboard listener is set up to run in an event loop, continuously monitoring for key events. It captures both
